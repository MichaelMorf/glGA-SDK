To get pyassimp to work:
>   - Install first latest assimp via macports: sudo port install assimp (version 5.0)
>   - Add opt/local/lib on helper.py (where the assimp library is)
>     - assimp/port/PyAssimp/pyassimp/structs.py
>       - Line 1088 inÂ 0adc032
>         - ("mPrivate", c_char_p),
>         - Deleting that line resolves the error.
